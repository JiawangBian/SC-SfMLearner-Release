## Contributions
  1. A geometry consistency loss, which makes the predicted depths to be globally scale consistent.
  2. A self-discovered mask, which detects moving objects and occlusions for boosting accuracy.
  3. Scale-consistent predictions, which can be used in the Monocular Visual SLAM system.

## Updates (Compared with NeurIPS version)
Note that this is an improved version, and you can find the NeurIPS version in 'Release / NeurIPS Version' for reproducing the results reported in paper. Compared with NeurIPS version, we
(1) Change networks by using Resnet18 and Resnet50 pretrained model (on ImageNet) for depth and pose encoders.
(2) Add 'auto_mask' by Monodepth2 to remove stationary points.
(3) Integrate the depth and pose prediction into the ORB-SLAM system.
(4) Add training and testing on NYUv2 indoor dataset. See [Unsupervised-Indoor-Depth](https://github.com/JiawangBian/Unsupervised-Indoor-Depth) for details.


## Preamble
This codebase was developed and tested with python 3.6, Pytorch 1.0.1, and CUDA 10.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. It is based on [Clement Pinard's SfMLearner implementation](https://github.com/ClementPinard/SfmLearner-Pytorch).


## Prerequisite

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

See "scripts/run_prepare_data.sh".

    For KITTI Raw dataset, download the dataset using this script http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=raw_data_downloader.zip) provided on the official website.

    For KITTI Odometry dataset, download the dataset with color images.

Or you can download our pre-processed dataset from the following link

[kitti_256 (for kitti raw)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2g1zyXt4mCKNbpdiw?e=ZJAhIl) | [kitti_vo_256 (for kitti odom)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2k3YRX5Z8c_i7U5x7?e=ogw0c7) | [kitti_depth_test (eigen split)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2kz5Zy7jWZd2GyMR2?e=kBD4lb) | [kitti_vo_test (seqs 09-10)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2k0BSVZE-AJNvye9f?e=ztiSWp)


## Training

The "scripts" folder provides several examples for training and testing.

You can train the depth model on KITTI Raw by running
```bash
sh scripts/train_resnet18_depth_256.sh
```
or train the pose model on KITTI Odometry by running
```bash
sh scripts/train_resnet50_pose_256.sh
```
Then you can start a `tensorboard` session in this folder by
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=checkpoints/
```
and visualize the training progress by opening [https://localhost:6006](https://localhost:6006) on your browser. 



## Evaluation

You can evaluate depth on Eigen's split by running
```bash
sh scripts/test_kitti_depth.sh
```
evaluate visual odometry by running
```bash
sh scripts/test_kitti_vo.sh
```
and visualize depth by running
```bash
sh scripts/run_inference.sh
```
